# Fly simulator

Magnificient application that allows you to control a perfectly drawed-in-paint fly that flies above a carpet.

#This thing even got a multiplayer!
So you can grab your friends and fly your flies together.


#To fulfill your urge to control the fly or whatever
- Head to the `/Debug/onlyFly/` directory
- Start server by executing `server.exe` command.
- Connect to server with `fly.exe $YOUR_SERVER_IP 3879` command.
- Use `arrow keys` to turn left right and increase/decrese altitude.
- Enjoy your journey!

You can also press `m` to see relative view position.

But you better not press other buttons because some of them are crashing client :neutral_face:

####Warning for explorers
Do not expect to see a well written code here.
